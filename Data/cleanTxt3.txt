The Nobel Prize (/ˈnoʊbɛl/Swedish pronunciation: [nʊˈbɛl]; Swedish definite form singular: Nobelpriset; Norwegian: Nobelprisen) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic cultural and/or scientific advances.
The will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in ChemistryLiteraturePeacePhysics and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[1] Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold and later from 18 carat green gold plated with a 24 carat gold coating. Between 1901 and 2015 the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 573 times to 900 people and organisations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once this makes a total of 23 organisations and 870 individuals—of whom 48 were women.[2]
The prize ceremonies take place annually in StockholmSweden (with the exception of the peace prize which is held in OsloNorway). Each recipient or laureate receives a gold medal a diploma and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation. (As of 2012[update] each prize was worth SEK8 million or about US$1.2 million €0.93 million or £0.6 million.) The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature medicine physics chemistry peace and economics.[3]
The prize is not awarded posthumously; however if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it the prize may still be presented.[4] Though the average number of laureates per prize increased substantially during the 20th century a prize may not be shared among more than three people.[5]
Alfred Nobel had the unpleasant surprise of reading his own obituary which was titled The merchant of death is dead in a French newspaper.
Alfred Nobel (listen(help·info)) was born on 21 October 1833 in StockholmSweden into a family of engineers.[6] He was a chemist engineer and inventor. In 1894 Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill which he made into a major armamentsmanufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime with most of his wealth from his 355 inventions of which dynamite is the most famous.[7]
In 1888 Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary titled The merchant of death is dead in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will.[8] On 10 December 1896 Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo Italy from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.[9]
Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died signing it at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[10][11] To widespread astonishment Nobel's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in physicschemistryphysiology or medicineliterature and peace.[12] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets 31 million SEK (c. US$186 million €150 million in 2008) to establish the five Nobel Prizes.[13][14] Because of scepticism surrounding the will it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway.[15] The executors of Nobel's will Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the award of prizes.[16]
Nobel's instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter the other prize-awarding organisations were designated or established. These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June the Swedish Academy on 9 June and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[17] The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and in 1900 the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[12] In 1905 the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved.
Alfred Nobel's will stated that 94% of his total assets should be used to establish the Nobel Prizes.
The Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.[18] In accordance with Nobel's will the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. Robert and Ludvig Nobel were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren who accessed the Nobel family archives it was this "decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established".[19] Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.[20][21] In many ways the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953).[22] Since the 1980s the Foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007 the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion Swedish kronor (c. US$560 million).[23]
According to the statutes the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However since 1995 all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute the Swedish Academy and the Norwegian Nobel Committee) the trustees of these institutions and auditors.[23]
Wilhelm Röntgen received the first Physics Prize for his discovery of X-rays.
Once the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place the Nobel Committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.
The Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-rays and Philipp Lenard's work on cathode rays. The Academy of Sciences selected Röntgen for the prize.[24][25] In the last decades of the 19th century many chemists had made significant contributions. Thus with the Chemistry Prize the Academy "was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize."[26] The Academy received 20 nominations eleven of them for Jacobus van't Hoff.[27] Van't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics.[28][29]
The Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers artists and literary critics protested against this decision having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded.[30] Some including Burton Feldman have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet.[31] The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.[32][33]
During the occupation of Norway three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military which was not at war with Sweden.[37] These members kept the work of the Committee going but did not award any prizes. In 1944 the Nobel Foundation together with the three members in exile made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.[34]
In 1968 Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honour of Nobel. The following year the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch "for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes."[38][39] Although not a Nobel Prize it is intimately identified with the other awards; the laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize recipients and the Prize in Economic Sciences is presented at the Swedish Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.[40] The Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition it would allow no further new prizes.[41]
Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3 000 individuals usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize inquiries are also sent to governments former Peace Prize laureates and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.[42][43] The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.[44] The nominees are not publicly named nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.[45][46]
The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This along with the list of preliminary candidates is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.[47] The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision which cannot be appealed is announced immediately after the vote.[48] A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize which can be awarded to institutions the awards can only be given to individuals.[49] If the Peace Prize is not awarded the money is split among the scientific prizes. This has happened 19 times so far.[50]
Although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to Erik Axel Karlfeldt and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to UN Secretary GeneralDag Hammarskjöld. Since 1974 laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate William Vickrey who in 1996 died after the prize (in Economics) was announced but before it could be presented.[51] On 3 October 2011 the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced; however the committee was not aware that one of the laureates Ralph M. Steinman had died three days earlier. The committee was debating about Steinman's prize since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.[4] The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize "was made in good faith" it would remain unchanged.[52]
Nobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made "during the preceding year". Early on the awards usually recognised recent discoveries.[53] However some of these early discoveries were later discredited. For example Johannes Fibiger was awarded the 1926 Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer.[54] To avoid repeating this embarrassment the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time.[55][56][57] According to Ralf Pettersson former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine "the criterion 'the previous year' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident."[56]
The committee room of the Norwegian Nobel Committee
The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement.[58][59] The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts.[60][61] However they can also be awarded for specific recent events.[62] For instance Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.[63] Similarly Yasser ArafatYitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.[64]
Although Nobel's will stated that prizes should be awarded for contributions made "during the preceding year" awards for physics chemistry and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted. Sometimes this takes decades – for example Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution.[65][66] Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised. Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died.[67][68][69]
Except for the Peace Prize the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm Sweden at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo Norway usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events.[70][71] The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies' are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall. The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946) at the auditorium of the University of Oslo (1947–1989) and at Oslo City Hall (1990–present).[72]
The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden. In Oslo the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway.[71][73] At first King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners. It is said that his mind changed once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden.[74]
The Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate guests include the President of the Storting the Prime Minister and since 2006 the King and Queen of Norway. In total about 250 guests attend.
According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize.[75][not in citation given][76][not in citation given] The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format.[77] These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet) but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910 after his term in office.[78] The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.[79]
It was announced on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket Sweden's oldest company ceased operations in 2011 after 1 017 years. In 2011 the Mint of Norway located in Kongsberg made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation.[80] Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics chemistry physiology or medicine and literature have identical obverses showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize but with a slightly different design. For instance the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal.[81] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.[82]
Laureates receive a heavily decorated diploma together with a gold medal and the prize money. Here Fritz Haber's diploma is shown which he received for the development of a method to synthesise ammonia.
All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold. Since then they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold but averages about 175 grams (0.386 lb) for each medal. The diameter is 66 millimetres (2.6 in) and the thickness varies between 5.2 millimetres (0.20 in) and 2.4 millimetres (0.094 in).[83] Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display Nobel medals are subject to medal theft.[84][85][86] During World War II the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark chemist George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid) to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war the gold was recovered from solution and the medals re-cast.[87]
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden or in the case of the peace prize the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.[81] The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.[88][89]
The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded.[81] The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s when the prize money was 880 000 SEK (c. 2.6 million SEK US$350 000 or €295 000 today) per prize. In 2009 the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million €950 000).[90][91] In June 2012 it was lowered to 8 million SEK.[92] If there are two laureates in a particular category the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.[93][94][95] It is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific cultural or humanitarian causes.[96][97]
When it was announced that Henry Kissinger was to be awarded the Peace Prize two of the Norwegian Nobel Committee members resigned in protest.
Among other criticisms the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda and of omitting more deserving candidates. They have also been accused of Eurocentrism especially for the Literature Prize.[98][99][100]
Peace Prize
Among the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ. This led to the resignation of two Norwegian Nobel Committee members. Lê Đức Thọ declined the prize.[101] Kissinger and Thọ were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973. However when the award was announced both sides were still engaging in hostilities.[102] Many critics were of the opinion that Kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite responsible for widening the war.[45][103]
Yasser ArafatShimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine.[45][104] Immediately after the award was announced one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned.[105] Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers.[106]
Another controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obamain 2009.[107] Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months.[50] Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award [108][109] or worthy of the company it would place him in.[110] Past Peace Prize laureates were divided some saying that Obama deserved the award and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.[111]
Literature Prize
The award of the 2004 Literature Prize to Elfriede Jelinek drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy Knut Ahnlund. Ahnlund resigned alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused "irreparable damage to all progressive forces it has also confused the general view of literature as an art." He alleged that Jelinek's works were "a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure."[112][113] The 2009 Literature Prize to Herta Müller also generated criticism. According to The Washington Post many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work.[114] This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric.[115]
The Norwegian Nobel Committee declined to award a prize in 1948 the year of Gandhi's death on the grounds that "there was no suitable living candidate."
James Joyce one of the controversial omissions of the Literature Prize
The Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937–39 1947 and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948.[118] Later members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize.[119] Geir Lundestad Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said "The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize. Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question".[120] In 1948 the year of Gandhi's death the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that "there was no suitable living candidate" that year.[119][121] Later when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989 the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi."[122] Other high profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out. Foreign Policy lists Eleanor RooseveltVáclav HavelKen Saro-WiwaSari Nusseibeh and Corazon Aquino as people who "never won the prize but should have."[123] The physicist Arnold Sommerfeld was nominated 81 times but an award was never made.[124]
In 1965 UN Secretary General U Thant was informed by the Norwegian Permananent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace prize committee lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis ending the war in the Congo and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.[125][126]
The strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial.[131] When a prize is awarded to recognise an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators one or more will miss out. For example in 2002 the prize was awarded to Koichi Tanaka and John Fenn for the development of mass spectrometry in protein chemistry an award that did not recognise the achievements of Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Frankfurt.[132][133] According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honour in 2013: the team of Carl HagenGerald Guralnik and Tom Kibble published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the Cosmos began but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to Peter Higgs and François Englert who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject. All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion albeit from different angles. Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years.[134]
Similarly the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded. In 1962 Francis CrickJames D. Watson and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize for discovering the structure of DNA. Rosalind Franklin a key contributor in that discovery died of ovarian cancer four years earlier.[135] The Economics Prize was not awarded to Fischer Black who died in 1995 when his co-author Myron Scholes received the honour in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role.
Political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition. Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann who co-discovered nuclear fission along with Otto Hahn may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the Nazis came to power.[136] The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognised until years later when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966 Enrico Fermi Award.
Alfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded "to those who during the preceding year shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."[137] He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given "to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics." Nobel did not emphasise discoveries but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg in papers published in Nature and Technoetic Arts have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society.[138][139]
Marie Curie one of four people who have received the Nobel Prize twice (Physics and Chemistry)
Four people have received two Nobel Prizes. Marie Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 for her work on radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium[140] making her the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. Linus Pauling won the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances. Pauling also won the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity.[141]Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA.[142][143]
Two organisations have received the Peace Prize multiple times. The International Committee of the Red Cross received it three times: in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary.[144][145][146] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981.[147]
Two laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. In 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Literature Prize but refused stating "A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution even if it takes place in the most honourable form."[160]Lê Đức Thọ chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the Paris Peace Accords declined stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam.[161]
During the Third Reich Adolf Hitler hindered Richard KuhnAdolf Butenandt and Gerhard Domagk from accepting their prizes. All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II. In 1958 Boris Pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return the Swedish Academy refused his refusal saying "this refusal of course in no way alters the validity of the award."[161] The Academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year holding it until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf.[162][163]Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in Burma; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later in 2012.[164]Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners.
The memorial symbol "Planet of Alfred Nobel" was opened in Dnipropetrovsk University of Economics and Law in 2008. On the globe there are 802 Nobel laureates' reliefs made of a composite alloy obtained when disposing of military strategic missiles.[165][166]
