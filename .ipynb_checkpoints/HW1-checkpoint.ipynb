    "### Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does entropy filtering improve the accuracy of the AffixTagger?\n",
    "As seen above, entropy filtering did not improve the unigram tagger's accuracy. Tests were done on suffixes of length 3 and 2. Only 2-long suffixes improved accuracy by a negligent sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do you determine the range of values to test for the cutoff?\n",
    "As seen in the graph above, the range which affected the context size was chosen as the tested cutoff range. At the beginning, the range was 0..3.5, but it was then reduced to 0..2 since the error was monotonously rising after roughly cutoff=6.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is the accuracy value evolving in a predictable manner as the cutoff varies?\n",
    "As the cutoff increases, accuracy reduces. As the cutoff increases, the model allows more suffix tagging, and relies less on the unigram tagger. In this particular case, the unigram tagging seems preferable to suffix tagging, and thus the trend makes sense. Perhaps on a larger database, suffix tagging would have shown better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Describe the list of suffixes that are good tag predictors -- are you surprised by what you observe?\n",
    "Many 2-letter words (or 2-letter initials) were chosen as good predictors, such as: 'pH', 'FM', 'AM', 'UK', 'Fe'. Suffixes like 'ed, 'es', 'ng', were not included. That means that at least on this corpus, the more general suffixes are rather ambigous. "

Without this method, the words \"32\" will be considered unkown even after observing other numbers, such as \"56\", \"34645\", \"4566254\" and \"1\". If the word does not fit one of the first 3 categories, the method returns the word itself (in lower case), to be tagged normally. "
